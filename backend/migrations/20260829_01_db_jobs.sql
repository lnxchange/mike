-- Migration date: 2026-08-29

-- Durable, Postgres-backed background jobs (the "DB queue").
--
-- WHY A SECOND QUEUE MECHANISM: the BullMQ queues (conversion/extraction) are
-- opt-in because they require Redis, which the default deployment does not
-- run. But some workloads must be durable in EVERY deployment — audit trails,
-- account deletion, export generation — and every deployment already has
-- Postgres. This table + claim function give those workloads at-least-once
-- execution with retries and crash recovery using nothing but the database
-- that is already there, so the DB queue can run BY DEFAULT with zero new
-- infrastructure (web, Word add-in, and Mac app stacks alike).
--
-- Concurrency model: workers claim batches via FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED, the
-- standard Postgres idiom for job queues — concurrent claimers never block
-- each other and never double-claim a row. Durable state machine per job:
--   pending --claim--> running --ok--> done
--                       |  \--error--> pending (run_at pushed back; retry)
--                       \--attempts exhausted--> failed (terminal, kept for
--                                                inspection)
-- Crash recovery: a worker that dies mid-job leaves it "running"; the claim
-- function re-claims running jobs whose claimed_at is older than the stale
-- threshold, so orphaned work resumes without any external supervisor.

-- Atomically claim up to p_limit runnable jobs. Returns the claimed rows.
--
-- "Runnable" is EITHER a due pending job OR a running job whose claim went
-- stale (worker crashed / was SIGKILLed mid-run) — folding crash recovery
-- into the claim itself means there is no separate reaper to keep in sync.
-- FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED makes concurrent claimers (multiple backend
-- replicas, or overlapping poll ticks) partition the work instead of racing:
-- locked rows are skipped, never waited on and never double-claimed.
--
-- THE ATTEMPT BUDGET APPLIES TO STALE RECOVERY TOO. The retry state machine
-- lives in the runner, which can only spend an attempt on a job whose handler
-- RETURNS control — it throws, the runner writes 'failed'. A job that kills
-- its worker (OOM, SIGKILL, a native crash in LibreOffice) never gets there:
-- it stays 'running', goes stale, and is reclaimed. Without the
-- attempts < max_attempts guard below that is an eternal crash loop — every
-- p_stale_seconds, forever, taking a worker with it each time. The guard makes
-- the budget mean the same thing for a crash as for an exception, and the
-- first CTE gives those spent rows the terminal 'failed' state they can never
-- reach on their own. The two sets are disjoint by construction (attempts >=
-- max_attempts versus attempts < max_attempts), so their order does not matter.

-- Claim ONE job by id — the Redis-delivery path (transactional-outbox
-- pattern). When Redis is configured, enqueue also adds a BullMQ "delivery"
-- job carrying this row's id so pickup is instant; the worker still claims
-- through Postgres via this function, so a duplicate delivery (BullMQ retry,
-- poller backstop racing the delivery) can never double-run the job: the
-- second claimer matches zero rows. Same stale-running recovery as the batch
-- claim, including its attempt budget: a job that kills its worker must not be
-- redelivered forever. Terminally failing a spent stale row is left to the
-- batch claim above, which every deployment runs (as the delivery mechanism
-- without Redis, as the lost-delivery backstop with it).
